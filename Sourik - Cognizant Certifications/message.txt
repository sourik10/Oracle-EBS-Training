Dear Swaroop,
I hope this message finds you well.

I was already suffering from Acid Reflux (GERD), Vomitting sensation, Stomach burn for many years and since again the problem arose a few weeks before I took a doctor appointment on (date) and doctor had prescribed some medicines and restricted diet and was following that. Now from the last 2 days, I have been experiencing severe vomiting, abdominal pain, and loosemotion due to intake of poor food quality and since I have GERD problem I have a very restricted diet too. 

The doctor has advised me to strictly avoid consuming any food from outside sources and follow a restricted diet like Plain dal , sabji and rice but it is not available as I stay in a Pg . I have been strictly told no fermented food like Idli or Dosa to be consumed as it increases my GERD problem more.

Given these circumstances, I kindly request permission to change my reporting location to Kolkata,  because in this time I need to intake home made food only.My Pg facility provides type of food, which poses a significant risk to my health. It is being a problem for both me and my parents as they are in a lot of stress because of my health reasons.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your understanding and support.
Best regards,

 Sourik Pan
